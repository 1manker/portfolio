      Python is my favorite language!  It is primarily what I have used for my research position, and most of my final classes.  I code in Python every day, and I'm always looking for new things to do with it.  Here is a list of the things I have implemented with Python.
      <br><br><br>
      <li>
      My current job requires that I scrape Google Scholar for bibliometric information.  The primary goal of this scraping is to compile a substantial amount of data and eventually conduct predictions for where an author's H-Index will be after a few years.  This information is important to faculty and administrators because it can illustrate how impactful a professor is within their field.  For better, or for worse, institutions are focusing less on teaching and more on research.  This repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/1manker/googleScraping">here</a>
      <br><br>
      <li>
      I have also implemented a Naive Bayes prediction algorithm with SKLearn on a basic model involving cars. This repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/1manker/AIhw6">here</a>
      <br><br>
      <li>
      I implemented a basic scraper to pull data from the Laramie airport and then predict the probability of weather patterns with a Markov chain. This repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/1manker/AIhw7">here</a>
      <br><br>
      <li>
      I created a Decision Tree prediction model from data found at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  This information detailed the results of surveys asking individuals about psychological traits and drug use.  I used this data to create models for predicting which individuals were most as risk for future drug abuse.  This repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/1manker/dataMiningProj">here</a>
      <br><br>
      <li>
      I implemented a Bloom Filter and the Flajolet Martin Algorithm to predict the number of unique sentences within a group of large files.  Manually checking and storing data in memory is impossible on data sets this large, so it is necessary to have a statistical model which can accurately predict the number of distinct patterns found within a file.
