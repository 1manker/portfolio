          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          My names is Lucas Manker and I'm a recent graduate from the University of Wyoming's Computer Science department.  I'm currently doing research under an National Science Foundation grant to examine bibliometric information present on Google Scholar.  I mostly work in Python and MYSQL, but I have experience in a few others.  I'm currently looking for employment as a software developer in the Salt Lake City area.
          <br><br>
          I'm a slightly older student and I spent most of my 20's doing blue collar work and teaching English in China.  I decided to go back to school in 2017 and pursue a degree in Computer Science.  I've always been passionate about computers and this degree has been a perfect fit for me.  
          <br><br>
          I enjoy card games, video games, and all sorts of nerdy stuff.  I am an avid reader, and I usually get through a few books a month.  I usually alternate between the classics and fantasy novels.  My favorite book is East of Eden by Steinbeck.  
          <br><br>
          If you would like to contact me about employment or anything else don't hesitate to drop by my LinkedIn or shoot me and email at lmanker@uwyo.edu.  Thanks for reading!
