      I am always trying to learn something new every day!  Here is what I have been working on since I have graduated.   
      <br><br><br>
      <li>
      I'm currently learning Django, and making basic web applications which use SQLite.  Django seems very powerful, and I'm excited to learn more.
      <br><br>
      <li>
      This webpage was made using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.  It is currently hosted on a Google virtual machine, with NGINX.  I hadn't ever dabbled in Web Development, and creating this site was an awesome learning experience.
      <br><br>
      <li>
      I have used nodeJS for an algorithms class and I've been brushing up on it.  JavaScript is awesome, and I'm currently looking for a project to build with it.
