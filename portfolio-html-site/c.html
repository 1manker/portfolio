      I have been studying C++ for several years and have made several interesting projects.  In my last year of University I have also implemented a few projects in C, and I am comfortable programming
      in both.  Here is what I have done so far!
      <br><br><br>
      <li>
      I created a Von Neumann emulator which mirrored the Von Neumann basic programming language.  This repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/1manker/vonNeumannEmulator">here</a>
      <br><br>
      <li>
      I implemented a basic compiler which reached the stages of tree creation.  This compiler was created for a basic Java syntax called Decaf.  The compiler parsed through code to create tokens with Yak, then sent the tokens to a grammar made in Bison. The repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/1manker/Compiler-1">here</a>
      <br><br>
      <li>
      I recreated the tar archive utility using the UStar format.  My recreated utility can archive and extract tar archives formatted in the older UStar format, and the files archived can be read by the standard tar utility. The repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/1manker/linuxhw6">here</a>
      <br><br>
      <li>
      I created a chatting application which mirrors the older Linux communication utility.  This application can connect via IP addresses and chat over the shell command line. The repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/1manker/linuxhw7">here</a>
      <br><br>
      <li>
      I implemented a basic Linux shell which can check general syntax, execute commands, and has basic pipe functionality.  The repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/1manker/linuxhw10">here</a>
      <br><br>
      <li>
      I created a matrix multiplication calculator with a dynamic number of threads chosen as command line arguments. The repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/1manker/linuxhw11">here</a>
