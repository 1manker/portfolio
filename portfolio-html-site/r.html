      R is the language I use for my research.  I have primarily used it to create the RShiny app for my research.  The syntax can be strange sometimes, but it's extremely powerful for conducting statistical research.

      R is the front end of my research project.  My application queries information from my database and presents it in the form of graphs and tables.  The graphs are concerned with the bibliometric information of a certain author.  Multiple authors can be compared by a number of different metrics.  A date range can be specified, and a zoom function is present to get a clearer picture of the information illustrated by the graphs.
