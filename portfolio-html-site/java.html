      I experience with Java is mostly tied to making Android applications.  Java is fantastic for making UI's, and it would be my choice for making any front-end applications.
      <br><br><br>
      <li>
      My first basic application in Java was making a tip calculator for Android phones.  This repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/1manker/android2">here</a>
      <br><br>
      <li>
      I also implemented a calculator application which could do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  Steps had to be put in place to make sure the number fit correctly and didn't overflow.

      <br><br>
      <li>
      I created an expense tracker which stored its data using SQLite.  Entries could be created, edited, and deleted.  This repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/1manker/android4">here</a>
      <br><br>
      <li>
      I made an application for the game Tic-Tac-Toe.  The game must determine when there is a winner, or a tie.  Then a new game can be started, or the application will quit.  The most challenging part of the project was making the application look aesthetically pleasing.  This repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/1manker/android5">here</a>
      <br><br>
      <li>
      The most challenging project I have implemented in Java was a controller for and online game.  My controller had to read and send packets over wifi to a central server, which updated player locations.  It was a fun project, and when our class finished we had a tournament to determine who had implemented the best controller.
