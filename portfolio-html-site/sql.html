      I use SQL every day!  I manage a database which stores information scraped from Google Scholar for my research position.  I primarily use MYSQL but I also have experience with SQLite.  SQL is awesome, and it's made my life so much easier.
      <br><br><br>
      <li>
      My primary use I have for MYSQL is related to the Python scraping project which is detailed more fully over at the Python page.  I have a table which tracks the Google Scholar profiles that are queued to be scraped, and those that have been scraped.  This table also has general information on the Google Scholar profiles, and the dates the information was collected.  Another table tracks each paper that has been published by the profile.  It stores the date of publication, and the citation information.  Another table stores the metrics for each profile on a year by year basis which allows for quicker queries in the RShiny app (more detail over at the R page).

      <li>
      I have used SQLite to support a expenditure tracking app for Android.  This database was very simple and stored simple information on expenses.
      <br><br>
      <li>
      I'm currently learning Django, and using SQLite to create awesome online applications.  More to come!
